## Submission Instructions

### Overview:

  For this project, I will be doing a todo list. As someone who can be quite forgetful, it will be a good asset that helps me keep on top of all of my tasks. The Users will be able to create an account and from there will be able to add and remove tasks, set deadlines, edit and change their tasks as life can be unpredictable, and mark their tasks as completed for that feeling of accomplishment. 
  
### Features:

  ~ Create and Account/Login - This is where new Users will be able to create and account and returning users will be able to log in.
  
  ~ Search - Users will be able to search for specific tasks that they have set.
  
  ~ Create ToDos - This is where the Users will be able to create and confirm the items on their todo list.
  
  ~ Dashboard - This is where the Users will be able to see all of their todos neatly organised.
  
  ~ Edit ToDos - This is where the Users will be able to edit their todo list items 
  
  ~Confirmation - This is where the Users will have to confirm if they want to edit or delete their ToDos/Reminders.
